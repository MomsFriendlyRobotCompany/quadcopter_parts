I am using a Naze32 rev6 board from Afroflight ... it is old. You can use Cleanflight 
configurator, but use the older 2.4 version because this board *is not supported* by
most modern flight control configuration systems anymore.

- STM32 F1 32b processor
- MPu6500 invensese Accel/Gyro
- BMP280 Barometer
- 16 Mb onboard memory

## Issues

- Not enough memory for GPS support :P

## Pinouts
